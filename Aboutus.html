<big> About us </big>
<p>
We believe that coffee is more than just a drink. It is a culture, an economy, an art, a science, and a passion. Whether you're new to the brew or an espresso expert, there's always more to learn about this beloved beverage.
The coffee place is India's favourite hangout for coffee and conversations. We strive to provide the best experience to our guests. Our coffees are sourced from thousands of small coffee planters, who made us who we are today and we're glad to be a part of their lives.
 We opened our first cafe in 1999 in mumbai - the youth and the young at heart immediately took to the cafe, and it continues to be one of the most happening places in the city.
 To the youth, it is a "hangout" spot where they meet people, make conversations, and have a whole lot of fun over steaming cups of great coffee.
 It's been an exciting journey since then to becoming the largest organised retail cafe chain in the country.
